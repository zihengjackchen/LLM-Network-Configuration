        "1. Line 128 with 'aggregate-address 2.128.0.0 255.255.0.0 summary-only' has an invalid subnet mask. The correct subnet mask for a /9 network should be 255.128.0.0 instead of 255.255.0.0.",
        "2. Line 144 with 'access-list 101 permit ip host 1.0.1.0 host 255.255.255.0' has an incorrect use of the term 'host'. The 'host' keyword should be followed by a single IP address, not a network address. The correct syntax should be 'access-list 101 permit ip 1.0.1.0 0.0.0.255 any' if the intention is to permit the entire 1.0.1.0/24 network.",
        "3. Line 145 with 'access-list 101 permit ip host 1.0.2.0 host 255.255.255.0' has the same issue as the previous line, using 'host' incorrectly. It should be 'access-list 101 permit ip 1.0.2.0 0.0.0.255 any'.",
        "4. Line 146 with 'access-list 103 permit ip host 3.0.1.0 host 255.255.255.0' also incorrectly uses the 'host' keyword. It should be 'access-list 103 permit ip 3.0.1.0 0.0.0.255 any'.",
        "5. Line 147 with 'access-list 103 permit ip host 3.0.2.0 host 255.255.255.0' has the same error as the previous line, and it should be 'access-list 103 permit ip 3.0.2.0 0.0.0.255 any'."
