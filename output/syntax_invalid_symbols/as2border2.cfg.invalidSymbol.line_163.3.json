        "1. Line 128 with 'aggregate-address 2.128.0.0 255.255.0.0 summary-only' has an invalid subnet mask. The correct subnet mask should be in the form of four octets, but '255.255.0.0' is missing the fourth octet.",
        "2. Line 144 and 145 with 'permit ip 10.23.21.2 0.0.0.0 10.23.21.3 0.0.0.0' in the IP access-list 'INSIDE_TO_AS3' has an incorrect wildcard mask. The wildcard mask '0.0.0.0' does not make sense in this context and should be '0.0.0.255' if the intention is to match a single host.",
        "3. Line 156 with 'access-list 101 permit ip host 1.0.1.0 host 255.255.255.0' has an incorrect use of the 'host' keyword. The 'host' keyword should be followed by a single IP address, not a network address. The correct syntax should be 'access-list 101 permit ip 1.0.1.0 0.0.0.255 any' if the intention is to permit the entire 1.0.1.0/24 network.",
        "4. Line 157 with 'access-list 101 permit ip host 1.0.2.0 host 255.255.255.0' has the same issue as the previous line, where the 'host' keyword is incorrectly used with a network address instead of a single IP address.",
        "5. Line 166 with '^route-map as2_to_as3 permit 2' has a syntax error indicated by the '^' character. This character is not part of the Cisco IOS configuration syntax and seems to be a typo or copy-paste error."
