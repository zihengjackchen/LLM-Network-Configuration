        "1. Line 128 with 'access-list 101 permit ip host 1.0.1.0 host 255.255.255.0' has an invalid IP address, the reason is that 'host 1.0.1.0' specifies a single host address, but '1.0.1.0' is a network address. The correct syntax should be 'access-list 101 permit ip 1.0.1.0 0.0.0.255 any' if the intention is to permit the entire subnet.",
        "2. Line 129 with 'access-list 101 permit ip host 1.0.2.0 host 255.255.255.0' has the same issue as the previous one, 'host 1.0.2.0' is incorrect because '1.0.2.0' is a network address, not a single host address.",
        "3. Line 130 with 'access-list 103 permit ip host 3.0.1.0 host 255.255.255.0' has the same issue as above, 'host 3.0.1.0' is incorrect because '3.0.1.0' is a network address.",
        "4. Line 131 with 'access-list 103 permit ip host 3.0.2.0 host 255.255.255.0' has the same issue as above, 'host 3.0.2.0' is incorrect because '3.0.2.0' is a network address.",
        "5. Line 92 with 'aggregate-address 2.128.0.0 255.255.0.0 summary-only' is potentially incorrect because the 'aggregate-address' command is used within the BGP configuration to summarize routes. However, the network '2.128.0.0 255.255.0.0' does not align with the 'ip prefix-list outbound_routes seq 5 permit 2.128.0.0/9 ge 16' which suggests that the intended summary should be a /9 and not a /16."
