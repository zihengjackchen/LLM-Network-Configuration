        "3. Line 149 and 150 with 'neighbor as1 route-map as1_to_as2 in' and 'neighbor as1 route-map as2_to_as1 out' are referencing a non-existent neighbor. The correct neighbor statements should reference the actual neighbor IP addresses or peer-groups defined in the BGP configuration.",
        "4. Line 163 with 'access-list 101 permit ip host 1.0.1.0 host 255.255.255.0' has an incorrect wildcard mask. The 'host' keyword should be followed by a single IP address, not a network address. The correct statement should be 'access-list 101 permit ip host 1.0.1.0 0.0.0.255'.",
