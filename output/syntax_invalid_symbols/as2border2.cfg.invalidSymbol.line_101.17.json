The 'host' keyword should be followed by a single IP address, not a network address. The correct syntax should be 'access-list 101 permit ip 1.0.1.0 0.0.0.255 any' if the intention is to permit the entire 1.0.1.0/24 network.",

        "4. Line 134 with 'access-list 103 permit ip host 3.0.1.0 host 255.255.255.0' also incorrectly uses the 'host' keyword. The correct syntax should be 'access-list 103 permit ip 3.0.1.0 0.0.0.255 any'.",
