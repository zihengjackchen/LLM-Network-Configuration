    "Correctness": "Yes",
    "RootCause": [
        "1. Line 97 with 'neighbor as1 peer-group' is incorrect because the peer-group 'as1' is not defined with a 'neighbor <ip-address> peer-group as1' command.",
        "2. Line 98 with 'neighbor as1 remote-as 1' is incorrect because the remote-as number should not be the same as the local AS number, which is 2 in this configuration.",
        "3. Line 107 with 'neighbor 2.1.2.1 update-source Loopback0' and line 109 with 'neighbor 2.1.2.2 update-source Loopback0' are incorrect because the IP addresses 2.1.2.1 and 2.1.2.2 do not match the network configured on the Loopback0 interface, which has the IP address 2.1.1.2.",
        "4. Line 123 with 'aggregate-address 2.128.0.0 255.255.0.0 summary-only' has an invalid subnet mask. The correct format for a subnet mask is four octets separated by periods, such as 255.255.0.0.",
        "5. Line 144 with 'access-list 101 permit ip host 1.0.1.0 host 255.255.255.0' and line 145 with 'access-list 101 permit ip host 1.0.2.0 host 255.255.255.0' are incorrect because the 'host' keyword is used with a single IP address, not a network. The correct syntax should be 'access-list 101 permit ip 1.0.1.0 0.0.0.255 any' for a network or 'access-list 101 permit ip host 1.0.1.1 any' for a single host."
