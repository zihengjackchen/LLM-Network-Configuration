    "Correctness": "Yes",

        "1. Line 97 with 'neighbor 2.1.2.1 update-source Loopback0' and line 99 with 'neighbor 2.1.2.2 update-source Loopback0' are incorrect because the update-source should be an interface that has an IP address in the same subnet as the neighbor's IP address. The Loopback0 interface has an IP address of 2.1.1.2, which is not in the same subnet as the neighbors 2.1.2.1 and 2.1.2.2.",
        "2. Line 123 with 'aggregate-address 2.128.0.0 255.255.0.0 summary-only' has an incorrect subnet mask. The correct subnet mask for the aggregate address should be in CIDR notation (e.g., /16) instead of a dotted decimal format.",
        "3. Line 135 with 'access-list 101 permit ip host 1.0.1.0 host 255.255.255.0' and line 136 with 'access-list 101 permit ip host 1.0.2.0 host 255.255.255.0' are incorrect because the 'host' keyword is used with an IP address, not a subnet mask. The correct syntax should not include the 'host' keyword before the subnet mask.",
        "4. Line 137 with 'access-list 103 permit ip host 3.0.1.0 host 255.255.255.0' and line 138 with 'access-list 103 permit ip host 3.0.2.0 host 255.255.255.0' have the same issue as lines 135 and 136, where the 'host' keyword is incorrectly used before a subnet mask.",
        "5. Line 148 with '&logging synchronous' is incorrect due to the presence of an unexpected character '&'. The correct command should be 'logging synchronous'."
