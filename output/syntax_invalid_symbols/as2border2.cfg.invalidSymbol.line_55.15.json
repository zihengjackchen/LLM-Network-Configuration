    "RootCause": [
        "1. Line 76 with 'no ip address&' has an invalid syntax, the reason is that the ampersand (&) is not a valid character in this context and the command should end with 'no ip address'.",
        "2. Line 108 with 'network 2.0.0.0 0.255.255.255 area 1' has an incorrect wildcard mask for OSPF configuration, the reason is that the wildcard mask should be '0.255.255.255' for the '2.0.0.0' network to correctly specify the range of addresses.",
        "3. Line 135 with 'aggregate-address 2.128.0.0 255.255.0.0 summary-only' has an incorrect mask, the reason is that the mask '255.255.0.0' specifies a /16 network, but the 'aggregate-address' command indicates a /9 network with '2.128.0.0/9'.",
        "4. Line 157 with 'permit ip 10.23.21.2 0.0.0.0 10.23.21.3 0.0.0.0' has an incorrect wildcard mask, the reason is that '0.0.0.0' does not correctly specify a single host, the correct wildcard mask for a single host should be '0.0.0.255'.",
        "5. Line 171 with 'access-list 101 permit ip host 1.0.1.0 host 255.255.255.0' has an incorrect use of the 'host' keyword, the reason is that 'host' should be followed by a single IP address, not a network address. The correct syntax should be 'access-list 101 permit ip 1.0.1.0 0.0.0.255 any' if the intention is to permit the entire '1.0.1.0/24' network."
