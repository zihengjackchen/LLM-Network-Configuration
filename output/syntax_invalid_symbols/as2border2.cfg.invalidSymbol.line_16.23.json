    "Correctness": "Yes",

        "1. Line 14 with 'ip cef)' contains a syntax error due to the extraneous closing parenthesis. The correct command should be 'ip cef'.",
        "2. Line 97 with 'interface Ethernet0/0' is followed by 'shutdown' which means the interface is administratively down and will not pass traffic. If this is not intentional, the 'shutdown' command should be removed to enable the interface.",
        "3. Line 135 with 'aggregate-address 2.128.0.0 255.255.0.0 summary-only' has an incorrect subnet mask for the specified aggregate address. The correct subnet mask for a /9 network is 255.128.0.0.",
        "4. Line 165 with 'access-list 101 permit ip host 1.0.1.0 host 255.255.255.0' has an incorrect use of the 'host' keyword. The 'host' keyword should be followed by a single IP address, not a network address. The correct syntax should be 'access-list 101 permit ip 1.0.1.0 0.0.0.255 any' if the intention is to permit the entire 1.0.1.0/24 network.",
        "5. Line 165 and 166 with 'access-list 101' and 'access-list 103' have incorrect IP addresses. The 'host' keyword is used with network addresses instead of a single host IP address. The correct usage should be without the 'host' keyword if the intention is to specify a network range."
