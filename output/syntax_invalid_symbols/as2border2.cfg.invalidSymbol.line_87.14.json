        "2. Line 106 with 'aggregate-address 2.128.0.0 255.255.0.0 summary-only' has an invalid IP address range, the reason is that the '2.128.0.0' with a mask of '255.255.0.0' does not correctly align with the natural classful boundary and should be '2.128.0.0/16' if summarizing a class B network.",
        "3. Line 123 with 'access-list 101 permit ip host 1.0.1.0 host 255.255.255.0' has an invalid access list statement, the reason is that 'host 1.0.1.0' specifies a single host but is followed by a subnet mask '255.255.255.0' which is not valid for a host entry.",
        "4. Line 124 with 'access-list 101 permit ip host 1.0.2.0 host 255.255.255.0' has the same error as the previous line, where 'host 1.0.2.0' is incorrectly followed by a subnet mask '255.255.255.0'.",
