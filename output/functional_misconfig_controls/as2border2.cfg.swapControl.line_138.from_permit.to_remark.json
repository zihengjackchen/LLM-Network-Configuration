    "Correctness": "Yes",
    "RootCause": [
        "1. Line 97 with 'interface Ethernet0/0' has an interface that is both administratively down (shutdown) and has no IP address assigned. This could be an oversight if the interface is meant to be used.",
        "2. Line 108 with 'ip access-group OUTSIDE_TO_INSIDE in' references an access list that is configured to deny all traffic from the 2.0.0.0/8 network to any destination, which might be too restrictive depending on the network design.",
        "3. Line 109 with 'ip access-group INSIDE_TO_AS3 out' references an access list that is not defined in the configuration, which will result in an error when the configuration is loaded.",
        "4. Line 135 with 'network 2.0.0.0 0.255.255.255 area 1' under 'router ospf 1' is potentially incorrect because it includes all IP addresses in the 2.0.0.0/8 range, which might not be intended for OSPF area 1.",
        "5. Line 165 with 'aggregate-address 2.128.0.0 255.255.0.0 summary-only' is likely incorrect because the summary address overlaps with the OSPF network range defined on line 135, which could cause routing issues."
