        "1. Line 128 with 'access-list 101 permit ip host 1.0.1.0 host 255.255.255.0' has an invalid IP address, the reason is that 'host 1.0.1.0' specifies a single host address, but '1.0.1.0' is a network address. The correct syntax should use a specific host address or remove the 'host' keyword.",
        "2. Line 129 with 'access-list 101 permit ip host 1.0.2.0 host 255.255.255.0' has the same issue as the previous one, 'host 1.0.2.0' is incorrect because '1.0.2.0' is a network address, not a host address.",
        "3. Line 130 with 'access-list 103 permit ip host 3.0.1.0 host 255.255.255.0' has the same issue as above, 'host 3.0.1.0' is incorrect because '3.0.1.0' is a network address.",
        "4. Line 131 with 'access-list 103 permit ip host 3.0.2.0 host 255.255.255.0' has the same issue as above, 'host 3.0.2.0' is incorrect because '3.0.2.0' is a network address.",
        "5. Line 97 with 'ip prefix-list outbound_routes seq 5 permit 2.128.0.0/9 ge 16' has an incorrect subnet mask, the reason is that '/9' indicates a subnet mask of 255.128.0.0, which does not align with the 'ge 16' statement. The 'ge 16' implies that the prefix length should be greater than or equal to 16, which is not possible with a '/9' prefix."
