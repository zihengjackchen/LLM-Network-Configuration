        "2. Line 135 with 'aggregate-address 2.128.0.0 255.255.0.0 summary-only' has an incorrect subnet mask for the specified aggregate address. The correct subnet mask for a /9 network should be 255.128.0.0.",
        "3. Line 165 with 'access-list 101 deny ip host 1.0.1.0 host 255.255.255.0' has an incorrect wildcard mask. The 'host' keyword should be followed by a single IP address, not a subnet mask.",
        "4. Line 166 with 'access-list 101 permit ip host 1.0.2.0 host 255.255.255.0' has the same issue as the previous line, with an incorrect wildcard mask following the 'host' keyword.",
