        "1. Line 97 with 'interface Ethernet0/0' has an interface that is both administratively down (shutdown) and has no IP address assigned. This could be an oversight if the interface is meant to be used.",
        "2. Line 135 with 'neighbor as1 peer-group' and subsequent lines defining peer groups for BGP neighbors are not followed by any 'neighbor <ip> peer-group as1' command to apply the peer group to a specific neighbor.",
        "3. Line 149 with 'aggregate-address 2.128.0.0 255.255.0.0 summary-only' has an incorrect subnet mask for the aggregate address. The correct subnet mask for a /9 network should be 255.128.0.0.",
        "4. Line 179 with 'ip community-list expanded as3_community remark _3:' is using the 'remark' keyword incorrectly. The 'remark' keyword is used to add comments to access lists, not to define a match condition.",
        "5. Line 191 with 'access-list 101 permit ip host 1.0.1.0 host 255.255.255.0' has an incorrect use of the 'host' keyword. The 'host' keyword should be followed by a single IP address, not a network address."
