The 'host' keyword should be followed by a single host IP address, but '1.0.1.0' is a network address. The wildcard mask '255.255.255.0' is incorrect for a single host and should be '0.0.0.0'.",

        "3. Line 130 with 'access-list 103 permit ip host 3.0.1.0 host 255.255.255.0' has the same issue as above. The 'host' keyword is followed by a network address '3.0.1.0' and an incorrect wildcard mask '255.255.255.0'.",
