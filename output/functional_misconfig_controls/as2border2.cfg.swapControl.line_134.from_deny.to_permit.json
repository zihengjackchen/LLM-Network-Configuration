    "Correctness": "Yes",
    "RootCause": [
        "1. Line 97 with 'interface Ethernet0/0' has an interface that is both administratively down (shutdown) and without an IP address. This could be an oversight if the interface is meant to be used.",
        "2. Line 135 with 'aggregate-address 2.128.0.0 255.255.0.0 summary-only' has an incorrect subnet mask for the specified aggregate address. The correct subnet mask for a /9 network should be 255.128.0.0.",
        "3. Line 149 with 'neighbor 2.1.2.1 update-source Loopback0' and line 150 with 'neighbor 2.1.2.2 update-source Loopback0' are potentially misconfigured because the neighbors are in the 2.1.2.0/24 network, which is not present in the configuration, and thus might not be reachable via Loopback0.",
        "4. Line 168 with 'access-list 101 permit ip host 1.0.1.0 host 255.255.255.0' and line 169 with 'access-list 101 permit ip host 1.0.2.0 host 255.255.255.0' are incorrect because the 'host' keyword is used with a network address instead of a single host IP address. The mask should be 0.0.0.255 if the intention is to specify a subnet.",
        "5. Line 170 with 'access-list 103 permit ip host 3.0.1.0 host 255.255.255.0' and line 171 with 'access-list 103 permit ip host 3.0.2.0 host 255.255.255.0' have the same issue as the previous point, using the 'host' keyword incorrectly with a network address."
