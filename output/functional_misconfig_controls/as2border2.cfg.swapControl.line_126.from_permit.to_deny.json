        "1. Line 97 with 'ip access-group OUTSIDE_TO_INSIDE in' references an access list that is applied to incoming traffic on the GigabitEthernet0/0 interface, but the access list 'OUTSIDE_TO_INSIDE' permits all traffic, which may not be the intended behavior.",
        "2. Line 97 with 'ip access-group INSIDE_TO_AS3 out' references an access list that is applied to outgoing traffic on the GigabitEthernet0/0 interface, but the access list 'INSIDE_TO_AS3' denies all traffic except for traffic from 10.23.21.2 to 10.23.21.3, which may not be the intended behavior.",
        "3. Line 135 with 'aggregate-address 2.128.0.0 255.255.0.0 summary-only' is potentially incorrect because the aggregate address overlaps with the network 2.0.0.0/8 which is denied by the prefix-list 'inbound_route_filter'.",
        "4. Line 161 with 'access-list 101 permit ip host 1.0.1.0 host 255.255.255.0' has an incorrect wildcard mask. The 'host' keyword should be followed by a single host IP address, not a wildcard mask.",
        "5. Line 162 with 'access-list 101 permit ip host 1.0.2.0 host 255.255.255.0' has the same issue as the previous line with an incorrect wildcard mask."
