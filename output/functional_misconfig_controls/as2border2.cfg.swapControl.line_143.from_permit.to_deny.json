        "1. Line 97 with 'ip access-group OUTSIDE_TO_INSIDE in' references an access list that is applied to incoming traffic on the GigabitEthernet0/0 interface, but the access list 'OUTSIDE_TO_INSIDE' denies all traffic from the 2.0.0.0/8 network, which includes the IP address of the interface itself (2.12.22.1), potentially blocking all incoming OSPF traffic.",
        "2. Line 97 with 'ip access-group INSIDE_TO_AS3 out' references an access list that is applied to outgoing traffic on the GigabitEthernet0/0 interface, but there is no corresponding access list 'INSIDE_TO_AS3' defined in the configuration, which will result in an error when the configuration is applied.",
        "3. Line 135 with 'aggregate-address 2.128.0.0 255.255.0.0 summary-only' has an incorrect mask for the aggregate address. The correct notation should be '255.255.128.0' to represent a /9 network.",
        "4. Line 165 with 'access-list 101 permit ip host 1.0.1.0 host 255.255.255.0' has an incorrect wildcard mask. The 'host' keyword specifies a single host, so the mask should be '0.0.0.0'. The correct line should be 'access-list 101 permit ip host 1.0.1.0 host 255.255.255.255'.",
