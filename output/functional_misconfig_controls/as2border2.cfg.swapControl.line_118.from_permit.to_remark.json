        "1. Line 97 with 'interface Ethernet0/0' has an interface that is both administratively down (shutdown) and without an IP address. This could be an oversight if the interface is meant to be used.",
        "2. Line 135 with 'aggregate-address 2.128.0.0 255.255.0.0 summary-only' has an incorrect subnet mask for the specified aggregate address. The correct subnet mask for a /9 network should be 255.128.0.0.",
        "3. Line 158 with 'access-list 101 permit ip host 1.0.1.0 host 255.255.255.0' uses the keyword 'host' which specifies a single host IP address, but '1.0.1.0' is followed by a subnet mask '255.255.255.0', which is incorrect syntax. The correct syntax should either specify a single host with 'host 1.0.1.0' or a network with '1.0.1.0 0.0.0.255'.",
        "4. Line 159 with 'access-list 101 permit ip host 1.0.2.0 host 255.255.255.0' has the same issue as the previous line with incorrect use of the 'host' keyword.",
