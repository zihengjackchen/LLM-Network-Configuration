    "Correctness": "Yes",

        "1. Line 97 with 'ip address 2.12.22.1 255.255.255.0' and line 101 with 'ip address 2.12.21.1 255.255.255.0' have overlapping IP addresses for interfaces GigabitEthernet1/0 and GigabitEthernet2/0. Both interfaces belong to the same subnet which can cause IP conflicts.",
        "2. Line 135 with 'aggregate-address 2.128.0.0 255.255.0.0 summary-only' has an incorrect subnet mask for the aggregate address. The subnet mask should be 255.255.128.0 to correctly represent a /9 prefix.",
        "3. Line 157 with 'permit ip 10.23.21.2 0.0.0.0 10.23.21.3 0.0.0.0' in the IP access-list INSIDE_TO_AS3 is incorrect because the wildcard mask is 0.0.0.0, which does not match any hosts. It should be 'permit ip host 10.23.21.2 host 10.23.21.3'.",
        "4. Line 171 with 'access-list 101 permit ip host 1.0.1.0 host 255.255.255.0' and 'access-list 101 permit ip host 1.0.2.0 host 255.255.255.0' are incorrect because the 'host' keyword is used with a network address instead of a single host address. The correct syntax should be 'access-list 101 permit ip 1.0.1.0 0.0.0.255 any' and 'access-list 101 permit ip 1.0.2.0 0.0.0.255 any'.",
        "5. Line 173 with 'access-list 103 permit ip host 3.0.1.0 host 255.255.255.0' and 'access-list 103 permit ip host 3.0.2.0 host 255.255.255.0' have the same issue as the previous point, where the 'host' keyword is incorrectly used with a network address."
