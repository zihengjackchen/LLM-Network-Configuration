    "Correctness": "Yes",
    "RootCause": [
        "1. Line 97 with 'ip address 10.23.21.2 255.255.255.0' and line 98 with 'ip access-group OUTSIDE_TO_INSIDE in' has a potential misconfiguration. The access list 'OUTSIDE_TO_INSIDE' denies all traffic from the 2.0.0.0/8 network, which includes the IP address of the interface itself, potentially blocking necessary OSPF or BGP traffic.",
        "2. Line 135 with 'aggregate-address 2.128.0.0 255.255.0.0 summary-only' may be incorrect because the network 2.128.0.0/16 is not present in any of the interface configurations or route statements, which could lead to advertising a non-existent network.",
        "3. Line 151 with 'neighbor 10.23.21.3 peer-group as3' is incorrect because there is no peer-group configuration commands for 'as3'. The peer-group needs to be defined before it can be assigned to a neighbor.",
        "4. Line 165 with 'access-list 101 permit ip host 1.0.1.0 host 255.255.255.0' and line 166 with 'access-list 101 permit ip host 1.0.2.0 host 255.255.255.0' are incorrect because the 'host' keyword is used with IP addresses that are not single hosts. The 'host' keyword should be followed by a single IP address, not a network address with a subnet mask.",
        "5. Line 167 with 'access-list 103 permit ip host 3.0.1.0 host 255.255.255.0' and line 168 with 'access-list 103 permit ip host 3.0.2.0 host 255.255.255.0' have the same issue as the previous point, using the 'host' keyword incorrectly with network addresses instead of single IP addresses."
