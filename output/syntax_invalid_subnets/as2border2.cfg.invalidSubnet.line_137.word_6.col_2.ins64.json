        "2. Line 135 with 'ip prefix-list outbound_routes seq 5 permit 2.@128.0.0/9 ge 16' contains a syntax error '@' in the IP address. It should be '2.128.0.0/9'.",
        "3. Line 139 with 'access-list 101 permit ip host 1.0.1.0 host 255.255.255.0' has an incorrect wildcard mask. The 'host' keyword specifies a single host, so the mask should be '0.0.0.0' instead of '255.255.255.0'.",
        "4. Line 140 with 'access-list 101 permit ip host 1.0.2.0 host 255.255.255.0' has the same issue as the previous line with an incorrect wildcard mask for the 'host' keyword.",
