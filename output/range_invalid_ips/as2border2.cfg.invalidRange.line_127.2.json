        "1. Line 92 with 'ip access-list extended INSIDE_TO_AS3' contains an invalid IP range 'permit ip 10.23.21.2 0.0.0.0 10.23.-66.3 0.0.0.0'. The fourth octet of the destination IP address is '-66', which is not a valid number for an IP address octet.",
        "2. Line 116 with 'access-list 101 permit ip host 1.0.1.0 host 255.255.255.0' uses the keyword 'host' followed by '1.0.1.0', which implies a single IP address, but the following 'host 255.255.255.0' is incorrect because '255.255.255.0' is a subnet mask, not a host IP address.",
        "3. Line 117 with 'access-list 101 permit ip host 1.0.2.0 host 255.255.255.0' has the same issue as the previous line, using a subnet mask '255.255.255.0' where a single host IP address should be specified.",
        "4. Line 118 with 'access-list 103 permit ip host 3.0.1.0 host 255.255.255.0' repeats the same error as lines 116 and 117, using a subnet mask instead of a host IP address.",
        "5. Line 119 with 'access-list 103 permit ip host 3.0.2.0 host 255.255.255.0' also repeats the error of using a subnet mask where a host IP address is expected."
