        "3. Line 116 with 'aggregate-address 2.128.0.0 255.255.0.0 summary-only' has an invalid subnet mask, the reason is that the subnet mask should be in the form of four octets separated by periods, and each octet should be a value between 0 and 255.",
        "4. Line 135 with 'access-list 101 permit ip host 1.0.1.0 host 255.255.255.0' has an incorrect wildcard mask, the reason is that the second 'host' keyword should be followed by a single IP address, not a wildcard mask.",
