        "1. Line 67 with 'network 300.0.0.0 0.255.255.255 area 1' has an invalid network address, the reason is that the first octet of the IP address is 300, which exceeds the maximum value of 255 for an octet.",
        "2. Line 92 with 'aggregate-address 2.128.0.0 255.255.0.0 summary-only' is incorrect because the mask should be in the format of four octets, but '255.255.0.0' has only three octets.",
        "3. Line 108 with 'ip prefix-list inbound_route_filter seq 5 deny 2.-88.0.0/8 le 32' contains an invalid IP address range '2.-88.0.0/8', as the second octet cannot be negative.",
        "4. Line 116 with 'access-list 101 permit ip host 1.0.1.0 host 255.255.255.0' is incorrect because the second 'host' keyword should be followed by a single IP address, not a subnet mask.",
