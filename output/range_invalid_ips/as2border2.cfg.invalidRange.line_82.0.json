    "Correctness": "Yes",
    "RootCause": [
        "1. Line 67 with 'bgp router-id 2.1.1.-57' has an invalid router ID, the reason is that the fourth octet of the router ID is -57, which is not within the valid range of 0 to 255 for an octet.",
        "2. Line 108 with 'aggregate-address 2.128.0.0 255.255.0.0 summary-only' has an invalid subnet mask, the reason is that subnet masks must consist of contiguous 1s followed by 0s, and '255.255.0.0' is not a valid mask for the '2.128.0.0' network.",
        "3. Line 118 and 119 with 'neighbor 2.1.2.1 activate' and 'neighbor 2.1.2.2 activate' are potentially incorrect because these neighbors are part of the 'as2' peer-group which is configured with 'remote-as 2', the same as the local AS. This could be a misconfiguration if the intent was to establish iBGP sessions.",
        "4. Line 132 with 'access-list 101 permit ip host 1.0.1.0 host 255.255.255.0' has an invalid host IP address, the reason is that '1.0.1.0' with a host mask of '255.255.255.0' is not a valid host address but a network address.",
        "5. Line 133 with 'access-list 101 permit ip host 1.0.2.0 host 255.255.255.0' has the same issue as the previous line, '1.0.2.0' with a host mask of '255.255.255.0' is a network address, not a host address."
