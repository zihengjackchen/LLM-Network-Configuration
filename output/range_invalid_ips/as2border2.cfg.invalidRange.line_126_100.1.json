        "1. Line 77 with 'aggregate-address 2.128.0.0 255.255.-23.0 summary-only' has an invalid subnet mask, the reason is that subnet masks cannot have negative numbers.",
        "2. Line 97 with 'permit ip 2.0.0.0 0.255.350.255 3.0.0.0 0.255.350.255' in the IP access-list 'INSIDE_TO_AS3' contains an invalid wildcard mask, as 350 is not a valid octet value.",
        "3. Line 108 with 'access-list 101 permit ip host 1.0.1.0 host 255.255.255.0' uses the keyword 'host' followed by an IP address, which implies a single host with a 32-bit mask, but it is followed by a subnet mask which is incorrect syntax.",
        "4. Line 109 with 'access-list 101 permit ip host 1.0.2.0 host 255.255.255.0' has the same issue as the previous line with the incorrect use of the 'host' keyword followed by a subnet mask.",
        "5. Line 110 with 'access-list 103 permit ip host 3.0.1.0 host 255.255.255.0' and line 111 with 'access-list 103 permit ip host 3.0.2.0 host 255.255.255.0' both have the same issue as lines 108 and 109."
