        "1. Line 128 with 'access-list 101 permit ip host 1.0.1.0 host 255.255.255.0' has an invalid wildcard mask. The correct wildcard mask should be 0.0.0.255 to match a single host.",
        "2. Line 128 with 'access-list 101 permit ip host 1.0.2.0 host 255.255.255.0' has an invalid wildcard mask. The correct wildcard mask should be 0.0.0.255 to match a single host.",
        "3. Line 129 with 'access-list 103 permit ip host 3.0.1.0 host 255.-92.255.0' contains an invalid wildcard mask with a negative number '-92'. The correct wildcard mask should be a positive number and in this context likely meant to be '0.0.0.255'.",
        "4. Line 97 with 'aggregate-address 2.128.0.0 255.255.0.0 summary-only' has an incorrect subnet mask. The correct subnet mask for a /16 network should be '255.255.0.0'.",
        "5. Line 91 with 'neighbor 10.23.21.3 peer-group as3' is incorrect because 'as3' is not defined as a peer-group but rather as a neighbor group. The correct command should be 'neighbor 10.23.21.3 peer-group as1' or 'neighbor 10.23.21.3 remote-as 3' if 'as3' is intended to be a remote AS."
