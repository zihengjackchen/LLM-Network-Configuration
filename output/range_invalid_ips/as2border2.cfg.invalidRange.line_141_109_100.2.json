        "1. Line 89 with 'aggregate-address 2.128.-3.0 255.255.0.0 summary-only' has an invalid IP address range, the reason is that the third octet is '-3', which is not a valid number for an IP address octet.",
        "2. Line 92 with 'neighbor 2.1.2.276 activate' has an invalid IP address, the reason is that the fourth octet is '276', which exceeds the maximum value of 255 for an octet.",
