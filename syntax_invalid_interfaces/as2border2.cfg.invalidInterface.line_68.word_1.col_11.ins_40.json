        "1. Line 67 with 'interface GigabitEthe(rnet1/0' has invalid syntax due to the inclusion of a parenthesis and a missing 'r' in 'Ethernet'. The correct interface name should be 'GigabitEthernet1/0'.",
        "2. Line 103 with 'aggregate-address 2.128.0.0 255.255.0.0 summary-only' has an invalid subnet mask. The correct subnet mask for a /9 prefix should be '255.128.0.0'.",
        "3. Line 116 with 'ip community-list expanded as1_community permit _1:' has an invalid regular expression for matching BGP communities. The underscore is not a valid character to start a community value. A correct expression might be '1:.*' to match any community starting with '1:'.",
        "4. Line 117 with 'ip community-list expanded as2_community permit _2:' has the same issue as the previous one with an invalid regular expression for matching BGP communities. It should be corrected similarly.",
        "5. Line 118 with 'ip community-list expanded as3_community permit _3:' also has the same issue with an invalid regular expression for matching BGP communities and should be corrected in the same manner."
