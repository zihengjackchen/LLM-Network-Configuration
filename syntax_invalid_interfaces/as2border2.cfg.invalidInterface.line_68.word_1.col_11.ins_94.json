        "3. Line 155 with 'ip access-list extended INSIDE_TO_AS3' has an incorrect wildcard mask in the second permit statement. The wildcard mask '0.0.0.0' does not allow any variation in the IP address, which makes the statement effectively useless.",
        "4. Line 172 with 'access-list 101 permit ip host 1.0.1.0 host 255.255.255.0' has an incorrect use of the 'host' keyword. The 'host' keyword should be followed by a single IP address, not a network address or a subnet mask.",
