        "3. Line 149 with 'access-list 101 permit ip host 1.0.1.0 host 255.255.255.0' has an incorrect use of the 'host' keyword. The 'host' keyword should be followed by a single IP address, not a network address. The correct syntax should be 'access-list 101 permit ip 1.0.1.0 0.0.0.255 any' if the intention was to permit the entire '1.0.1.0/24' network.",
